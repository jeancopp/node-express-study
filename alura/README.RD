A little node.js study.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I did study of basic modules and i started to build a solution with express+mysql+ejb.

I will update this every week and, after i return to have internet at my home, I going to update this project two or three time on the week.

 (Yes, I don't have internet in my home. Yes, I'm really sad because of this, but, in Brazil, the companys don't has a offer a good internet plan for a good price)
